Nodejs Master Class Assignment #1

Homework Assignment #1
The Assignment:

Create a simple "Hello World" API. Meaning:

1. It should be a RESTful JSON API that listens on a port of your choice. 

2. When someone posts anything to the route /hello, you should return a welcome message, in JSON format. 
This message can be anything you want.


As for the code, 
The structure is a main function as seen on the lectures, is the callback for "http.CreateServer", did not include the StringDecoder since no parsing of body is required, the port and environment name goes in config.js.
